# The Singing Glock

In this repo you'll find all the code I used to make my final project. Glockenspiel contains the actual final code that's used in the device.

The four test folders contain test code for different components: the solenoids, the YIN pitch estimation algorithm, and the 595 shift registers (which were not used in the final version of the device).
